# FirstSpirit Connect for Commerce - BigCommerce Bridge

## Overview

### Connect for Commerce Bridge API

The bridge API serves as a REST interface which is able to fetch content, product and category information from any shop backend and to display them in reports in the FirstSpirit ContentCreator.

In order to connect the bridge API with a given shop backend a bridge is needed. It acts as a microservice between the shop backend and FirstSpirit. Further information about how to implement and use a bridge can be found in the official [documentation](https://docs.e-spirit.com/ecom/fsconnect-com/FirstSpirit_Connect_for_Commerce_Documentation_EN.html).

### BigCommerce

### Run bridge
Before starting the bridge for the first time, you have to install its dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To start the bridge run:

```
npm start
```

### Run bridge in development mode
To start the bridge and re-start it whenever a file changed:
```
npm run start:watch
```

### View the Swagger UI interface

Open http://localhost:3000/docs in your browser to display the bridge's interactive API documentation.

### Configure FirstSpirit Module
In order to enable the Connect for Commerce FirstSpirit Module to communicate with the bridge, you have to configure it. Please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.e-spirit.com/ecom/fsconnect-com/FirstSpirit_Connect_for_Commerce_Documentation_EN.html#install_pcomp) to learn how to achive this.

### Multi-Tenant Support
We provide an example `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to enable multi-tenant support for this service.

Build and tag the Docker image with a custom name and version:
```docker
docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME>:<VERSION> .
```

The `docker-compose.yml` demonstrates how to define multiple instances of the bridge with a different configuration.

Replace `<IMAGE_NAME>:<VERSION>` with the name and tag that you chose for your Docker image.
Each configuration for an instance is set with a different `.env.*` file. The path to it needs to be defined under `env_file`.

Start the containers:
```docker
docker compose up -d
```

Stop the containers:
```docker
docker compose down
```

Please be aware that the Docker containers need to be accessible from your FirstSpirit instance in order to work with the Connect for Commerce module. A deployment to a Cloud provider might be necessary for this.
